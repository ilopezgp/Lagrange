I am a PhD candidate at the California Institute of Technology, working with Tapio Schneider and J&ouml;rn Callies. My research focuses on climate modeling and prediction, physical oceanography and atmospheric dynamics. I am also part of the Climate Modeling Alliance ([CliMA](https://clima.caltech.edu)) and the [Resnick Sustainability Institute at Caltech](http://resnick.caltech.edu).

Prior to this, I studied Aerospace Engineering at Universidad Polit&eacute;cnica de Madrid (BSc, 2016) and ISAE-SUPAERO (MSc, 2018). I am broadly interested in the quantitative analysis and mathematical modeling of physical systems. Mathematical models can help us understand and predict the behavior of physical systems that have a direct impact on society, such as weather and climate. 

My most recent [work](https://clima.caltech.edu/2020/12/04/resolving-small-scale-uncertainties-in-climate-models/) focuses on the development of a mathematical model of turbulence and convection in Earth's atmosphere, processes that govern the dynamics of clouds and have an outsized effect on climate.
