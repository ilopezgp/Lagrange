I am a Research Scientist at Google Research. My research focuses on weather and climate prediction, atmospheric dynamics, and modeling Earth systems through physics and machine learning. I got my PhD at the California Institute of Technology, working with Tapio Schneider. I am also part of the Climate Modeling Alliance ([CliMA](https://clima.caltech.edu)).

I am broadly interested in the study and mathematical modeling of physical systems that have a direct impact on society, such as weather and climate. Mathematical models, be they empirical or data-driven, can help us understand and predict the behavior of physical systems. This understanding can then be leveraged to make informed decisions that minimize negative impacts on human populations. For example, better weather prediction models can help reduce the impact of heat waves and storms. Better climate models can elucidate the existence of tipping points and positive warming feedbacks in the climate system beyond what is currently observable.
