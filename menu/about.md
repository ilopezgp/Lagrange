title: About Me
---

I am a PhD candidate at the California Institute of Technology, working with Tapio Schneider and Joern Callies. My research focuses on climate modeling and prediction, physical oceanography and atmospheric dynamics. 

Prior to this, I studied Aerospace Engineering at Universidad Polit&eacute;cnica de Madrid (BSc) and ISAE-SUPAERO (MSc). I am broadly interested in mathematical modeling of physical systems. Mathematical models can help us understand and predict the behavior of physical systems that have a direct impact on society, such as climate.
