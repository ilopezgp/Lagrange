![image tooltip here](/assets/img/mountains.jpg)

I am a PhD candidate at the California Institute of Technology, working with Tapio Schneider and J&ouml;rn Callies. My research focuses on climate modeling and prediction, physical oceanography and atmospheric dynamics. I am also part of the Climate Modeling Alliance ([CliMA](https://clima.caltech.edu)).

Prior to this, I studied Aerospace Engineering at Universidad Polit&eacute;cnica de Madrid (BSc) and ISAE-SUPAERO (MSc). I am broadly interested in mathematical modeling of physical systems. Mathematical models can help us understand and predict the behavior of physical systems that have a direct impact on society, such as climate.
