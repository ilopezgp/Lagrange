I am a PhD candidate at the California Institute of Technology, working with Tapio Schneider. My research focuses on climate modeling and prediction, machine learning for Earth systems, and atmospheric dynamics. My research is currently supported by an Amazon AI4Science Fellowship. I am also part of the Climate Modeling Alliance ([CliMA](https://clima.caltech.edu)) and the [Resnick Sustainability Institute at Caltech](http://resnick.caltech.edu). Prior to this, I studied Aerospace Engineering at Universidad Polit&eacute;cnica de Madrid (BSc, 2016) and ISAE-SUPAERO (MSc, 2018).

I am broadly interested in the study and mathematical modeling of physical systems that have a direct impact on society, such as weather and climate. Mathematical models, be they empirical or data-driven, can help us understand and predict the behavior of physical systems. This understanding can then be leveraged to make informed decisions that minimize negative impacts on human populations. For example, better weather prediction models can help reduce the impact of heat waves and storms. Better climate models can elucidate the existence of tipping points and positive warming feedbacks in the climate system beyond what is currently observable.

In November 2022, I will be joining Google Research as a Research Scientist.
